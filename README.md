# MapperHX / MapperHaxe (The Charting Engine)

This is a special engine specifically designed for charting, and that only.
If you would like to do more advanced things like adding danger notes, more keys, etc.. I'd recommend compiling the source code.

Your own personal charting workspace, doesn't have to be special, doesn't have to be advanced.. just personal.

## This Engine Contains
- Softcoded Songs
- Cool Features
- Not an entire engine to chart a song âœŒ
